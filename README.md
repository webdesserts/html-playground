# HTML Playground

## Pre-requisites

1. [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) â€“ we need this to start our tiny server
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - you can use git to quickly copy this project to your computer

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/webdesserts/html-playground.git
cd html-playground
npm start
```

This will start a server at `localhost:3000` and open it in your
default browser.
